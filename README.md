# Tic-Tac-Toe
A Tic Tac Toe game in Python is a simple project where two players take turns marking spaces in a 3x3 grid. The objective is to get three of their marks (either 'X' or 'O') in a row, column, or diagonal. 
This project helps practice basic Python programming concepts such as loops, conditionals, functions, and lists. It's also a good exercise in implementing game logic and user interaction through the console.
